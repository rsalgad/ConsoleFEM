# ConsoleFEM

This is a finite element program under development.

To properly build this code, the folders eigen-3.3.7 needs to be placed in the same directory as the solution (as it is configured in the solution properties).

In addition, tinyxml2 is required. For now, it is included as a header and cpp files inside the project. But I believe it should be reference as a library, such as with eigen-3.3.7.
